# Contributing to funes

Contributions are welcome — bug reports, fixes, documentation, and features. Bug reports and
docs improvements can go straight to an issue or PR. For features, please read the section
below first.

## Before you build a feature

Open an issue describing the **problem** before investing time in an implementation. funes is
built on a small set of deliberate, load-bearing constraints — append-only storage, no LLM in
the ingest path, local-first, recall pulled rather than injected — documented in
[docs/RATIONALE.md](docs/RATIONALE.md). A feature that fights one of these (LLM summarization
at ingest, mutable "facts", proactive memory injection) is a different product, not a missing
feature, and will be declined; an issue costs you an hour less than a PR does.

Two more places to look before proposing:

- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) holds the conventions and the hardened decisions, and names the four
  surfaces that describe a verb — CLI help, MCP tool descriptions, docs, and the output shape. A
  change to one of them is a change to all four.
- Adding support for another agent means implementing the [`TraceSource`](src/source.rs)
  trait — the indexing and query paths should not need to change.

## Development setup

You need:

- **Rust** (stable; CI builds with 1.95.0)
- **`protoc`** — `lance`'s build scripts compile protobuf at build time:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler   # Debian/Ubuntu
  brew install protobuf                        # macOS
  # …or repo-local, no sudo:
  ./scripts/bootstrap-protoc.sh
  export PROTOC="$PWD/.tools/protoc/bin/protoc"
  ```

- **[trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog)** — the pre-publish secret
  gate shells out to it (CI pins v3.95.5). Needed on `PATH` (or via `FUNES_TRUFFLEHOG`) to run
  the secret-scan tests and `funes push`.

## Building and testing

For native Windows setup and the PowerShell test suite, see [docs/windows.md](docs/windows.md).
Run `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/test-windows.ps1` for the
hermetic installer and detached-worker tests.

```bash
cargo build --release          # binary at target/release/funes
cargo test --lib               # unit tests — hermetic, no network
cargo test                     # full suite; first run downloads the embedder/reranker weights
```

The tests that talk to the Hugging Face Hub (`remote_recall`, `push_round_trip`) skip
themselves unless `HF_FUNES_TEST_TOKEN` is set — on a fork they simply don't run, and that's
fine; CI runs them with the repository secret.

## Style

- **Format** with `cargo fmt` (stable rustfmt; [rustfmt.toml](rustfmt.toml) carries the one
  setting that differs from defaults).

- **Lint** both backend variants — warnings are errors in CI:

  ```bash
  cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
  cargo clippy --all-targets --no-default-features --features onnx -- -D warnings
  ```

- Doc-comment the public surface; comments carry the non-obvious *why*, not a restatement of
  the code.

- **One directory per layer**, each with one job — `src/` holds `main.rs`, `lib.rs` and the layer
  roots, nothing else:

  | Layer | Job |
  |---|---|
  | `traces/` | where sessions come from, how each harness's transcript is parsed, and the `Turn`/`Block` model they produce |
  | `chunk.rs`, `scan.rs` | the models the layers share: chunk text and ids, secret findings |
  | `inference/` | embedding and reranking behind traits (backend chosen at build time) |
  | `hub.rs` | **transport**: the Hub's client, credentials, and dataset-repo identity and lifecycle. Knows nothing about memories — `memory`, `traces` and `commands` all call it |
  | `memory/` | the memory itself: Lance and object-store **mechanics** (`dataset`, `fetch_store`, `capture_store`), its remote side (`remote`), under a **domain** (`memory.rs`) that says what a memory is and what state it's in |
  | `commands/` | what funes does when you run it: orchestration and decisions |
  | `ui/` | how a result reaches the terminal |
  | `agents/` | registering funes with a coding agent (MCP + automation hooks) |
  | `platform.rs` | shared host filesystem conventions (profile discovery and path classification) |

  Where does a new function go? Names an HF concept → transport. Names Lance → mechanics.
  Answers *what is this memory, what state is it in* → domain. Decides *what to do about it* →
  command.

  Commands **ask** the domain for state — `Memory::state()` returns a `MemoryState`, and the
  message for a state a command can only stop on comes from the memory itself
  (`memory.missing_error()`). Don't read state out of an error shape: four different answers to
  "does this memory exist" grew that way, and collapsing them was the point of the layering.

- Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`): short imperative subject, the
  "why" in the body when it isn't obvious.

## Pull requests

1. Branch from `main`; keep the PR focused on one concern.
2. Add or update tests for any behavior you change.
3. Run fmt, both clippy variants, and the test suite before pushing.
4. In the description, say what changed and why, and link the issue it resolves.
